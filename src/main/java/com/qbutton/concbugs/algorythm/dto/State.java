/**
 * The state is a 5-tuple consisting of:
 *
 * - The current lock-order graph. Each node in the graph is a symbolic heap
 * object. The graph represents possible locking behavior for concrete heap
 * objects drawn from the sets modeled by the symbolic heap objects. A path
 * of nodes o1 ... ok in the graph corresponds to a potential program path in
 * which o1 is locked, then o2 is locked (before o1 is released), and so on.
 *
 * - The roots of the graph. The roots represent objects that are locked at some
 * point during execution of a given method when no other lock is held.
 *
 * - The list of locks that are currently held, in the order in which they were
 * obtained.
 *
 * - An environment mapping local variables to symbolic heap objects. The
 * environment is an important component of the interprocedural analysis, as it
 * allows information to propagate between callers and callees. It also improves
 * precision by tracking the
 * ow of values between local variables.
 *
 * - A set of objects that have had wait called on them without an enclosing
 * synchronized statement in the current method.
